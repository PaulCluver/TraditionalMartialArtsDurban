            What is Xing Yi Chuan Kung Fu?
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Xing Yi Chuan roughly translated means mind and body form. In practice, the student trains the mind (Yi) to control the body (Xing). This connects the inner, internal power (Nei Gong) with the outer, external shape (Wai Xing). The form or "shape" of the movements is the physical manifestation of the "shape" of one's intent. In application, the practitioner strives to be aggressive and to develop an active and explosive offence. The direction of the forms is direct and linear.

                    According to the principles of this style, attacking with clear intent serves as the best defence with attack and defence occurring simultaneously. Action and movement are tight and compact, limiting any openings for counterattack.

                        The Xing Yi Five Elements are in effect the five energies that, according to Taoist cosmology, comprise the energy matrix of the universe. In addition, each of the following Xing Yi Five Elements utilize a particular hand technique that moves power along a specific physical force vector.
