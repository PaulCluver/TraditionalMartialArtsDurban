                    Xing Yi Chuan roughly translated means mind and body form. In practice, the student trains the mind (Yi) to control the body (Xing). This connects the inner, internal power (Nei Gong) with the outer, external shape (Wai Xing). The form or "shape" of the movements is the physical manifestation of the "shape" of one's intent. In application, the practitioner strives to be aggressive and to develop an active and explosive offence. The direction of the forms is direct and linear.

                        According to the principles of this style, attacking with clear intent serves as the best defence with attack and defence occurring simultaneously. Action and movement are tight and compact, limiting any openings for counterattack.

                    Some basic principles of Xing Yi Chuan include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Find Your Yi:</b> The first level of Xing Yi Chuan training is in finding your Yi. When you tap into and unlock this feeling, you are able to truly move your chi within the body and thus take on the various shapes that Xing Yi Chuan requires.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Go through:</b> The striking energy of Xing Yi Chuan is like a crossbow bolt. Your body remains rooted and stable while your arm or leg shoots out. The strike going straight forward and through the opponent.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Protect your Centre:</b> Xing Yi Chuan has a very closed posture with the limbs drawn in to protect the sensitive points along the middle of the body such as the eyes, throat and groin. This posture is very uncomfortable at first but starts to feel incredibly natural after a relatively short time of training.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Enhance the Six Harmonies:</b> Xing Yi Chuan, like many internal arts, utilises the six harmonies. This involves the joining of the three internal powers and the three external powers to create a stable and powerful fighter. Intellectually these can be easily understood, but long hours of training are required to experience them and truly know them. These six harmonies are the reason that Xing Yi Chuan can generate incredible striking power.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Xing Yi Five Elements are in effect the five energies that, according to Taoist cosmology, comprise the energy matrix of the universe. In addition, each of the following Xing Yi Five Elements utilize a particular hand technique that moves power along a specific physical force vector.
